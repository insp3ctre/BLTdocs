## Accounts
In order to gain access to the cluster, you first need an account. Contact the BLT Admins to request an account.

NOTE: Once you receive a temporary password, please reset it within 5 days of gaining access to the system.

## Getting On The Network
The BLT cluster is quite isolated from LC's public-facing infrastructure. In order to connect to it, you will need a copy of Cisco AnyConnect secure mobility client, which is available to LC students, faculty, and staff [https://vpn.lclark.edu HERE].

If you are using Linux to connect to the cluster, the current version of Cisco AnyConnect will fail to install. Luckily, there is an open-source equivalent called [http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/index.html OpenConnect], which installs as a menu option for debian and redhat based OSes. You will need to open your network settings and click the green plus button to add a new connection, and then select VPN when prompted. After that, put in <code>vpn.lclark.edu</code> for the gateway option and the same root CA certificate as you used when setting up LC secure. After you click save, it will ask for your LC id and password. 

After you have installed and started AnyConnect:
<ol>
    <li>Start a VPN session by typing <code> vpn.lclark.edu </code> in the text box and clicking "connect"</li>
    <li>When prompted, put in your LC username and password for access</li>
</ol>

Now, your computer is connected to the same virtual network as the cluster.

## Logging In
NOTE: In order to log in, you will need an SSH client. If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, you already have one. If you are using Windows, you will need to install [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html PuTTY] or similar.

<ol>
    <li>Open your SSH client
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On Mac</strong> Press the space bar and command key at the same time. then type "Terminal" and hit return</li>
            <li><strong>On Linux</strong> Open a terminal window</li>
            <li><strong>On Windows</strong> Open PuTTY</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Log In!
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On Mac or Linux </strong>type <code>ssh <lclark username>@mayo.blt.lclark.edu</code> and type your password when prompted</li>
            <li><strong>On Windows</strong> Open PuTTY, set "Host Name" to mayo.blt.lclark.edu and click "Open", and follow the prompt.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
