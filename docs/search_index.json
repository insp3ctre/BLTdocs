Contact the BLT Admins to request an account. NOTE: Once you receive a temporary password, please reset it within 5 days of gaining access to the system. 1.2 Getting on the network The BLT cluster is quite isolated from LC’s public-facing infrastructure. In order to connect to it, you will need a copy of Cisco AnyConnect secure mobility client, which is available to LC students, faculty, and staff HERE. If you are using Linux to connect to the cluster, the current version of Cisco AnyConnect will fail to install. Luckily, there is an open-source equivalent called OpenConnect, which installs as a menu option for debian and redhat based OSes. You will need to open your network settings and click the green plus button to add a new connection, and then select VPN when prompted. After that, put in vpn.lclark.edu for the gateway option and the same root CA certificate as you used when setting up LC secure. After you click save, it will ask for your LC id and password. "],
